If we look at the median price for each \"block\", we can use a data set which is less skewed. It is interesting because of the range of prices, we might be able to find a model which can explain the relationship between median house cost and the attributes of the houses. So, can we find a model that can predict house cost?\n\n## The Data\n\nLooking at a map of the houses in California with information on the house price and population, we can see that areas close to the coast, like LA and San Francisco, have a higher cost while more inland areas have a lower cost.\n\n```{r, echo = F, results='hide',fig.keep='all', warning = F, message=FALSE}\ninvisible(library(tidyverse))\ninvisible(library(ggthemes))\ninvisible(library(Hmisc))\ninvisible(library(viridisLite))\n\nus_states <- map_data('county')\n\ncali_dat <- read.csv('california_housing.csv')\n\n\nla <- c('LA', -118.15, 34.03)\nsf <- c('San Francisco', -122.24, 37.46)\n\nlocs <- as.data.frame(matrix(c(la, sf), nrow = 2, byrow = T))\ncolnames(locs) <- c('place','long','lat')\n\nggplot(cali_dat) +\n  geom_polygon(data = filter(us_states, region == 'california'),\n               mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),\n               fill = \"white\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_point(aes(x = longitude, y = latitude, color = medianHouseValue, size = population), alpha = .5) +\n  coord_fixed() +\n  theme_map() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\") +\n  scale_color_continuous(type = 'viridis') +\n  labs(color = 'Median House Value', size = 'Population', title = 'Median House Prices and Population in California') +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(data = locs, aes(x = as.numeric(long), y = as.numeric(lat), label = place), hjust = 3, \n                           vjust = 3)\n\n\nhist.data.frame(cali_dat)\n```\n\nSince we are dealing with ordered pair data for location, it might be important to create a new variable which represents the distance to the coast. This could be obtained using Tableau.\n\n## Model Type\n\nOur model will most likely use a linear model.\n\n## Plans\n\nWe could use modified data which could be represented as proportions or percentages. For example, we have totalRooms and totalBedrooms variables. If we consider a variable of percentage of rooms which are bedrooms, the numbers would be better represented. We could expect more expensive houses to have lower percentage of bedrooms compared to cheaper houses.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"include-after-body":["target_blank.html"],"output-file":"mtpres.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","theme":{"light":"flatly","dark":["darkly","theme-dark.scss"]},"title":"Midterm Presentation","editor":"visual"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
